Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of June 23rd 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

# About

See above.

This is the place on SNU where programs can be tested online, and programmed online, with any programming language, markup language, etc.

Every language is also separated into its own repository, via an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which is an environment with tools that helps you program in each language.

[View the organization here](https://github.com/SNU-Programming-Tools)

This project is still in early development, and is part of the [SNU project](https://github.com/snu-development)

## Alternatives

Some alternatives to online programming include:

[TIO (Try it Online)](https://tio.run/)

[Codeskulptor (Python only)](http://www.codeskulptor.org/)

> [Python 2.x](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/)

> [Python 3.x](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/)

[Repl.it](https://replit.com/) - Online programming IDE in 50+ languages

## Samples

### Python Samples

#### Hello World in Python

```python
print('Hello, world!')
```

### C samples

#### Hello World in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

#### Long keyword in C

```c
long some_function();
/* int */ other_function();

/* int */ calling_function()
{
    long test1;
    register /* int */ test2;

    test1 = some_function();
    if (test1 > 0)
          test2 = 0;
    else
          test2 = other_function();
    return test2;
}
```

### C Plus Plus samples

#### Hello World in C Plus Plus

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
}
```

#### Exception Handling in C Plus Plus

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stdexcept>

int main() {
    try {
        std::vector<int> vec{3, 4, 3, 1};
        int i{vec.at(4)}; // Throws an exception, std::out_of_range (indexing for vec is from 0-3 not 1-4)
    }
    // An exception handler, catches std::out_of_range, which is thrown by vec.at(4)
    catch (std::out_of_range &e) {
        std::cerr << "Accessing a non-existent element: " << e.what() << '\n';
    }
    // To catch any other standard library exceptions (they derive from std::exception)
    catch (std::exception &e) {
        std::cerr << "Exception thrown: " << e.what() << '\n';
    }
    // Catch any unrecognised exceptions (i.e. those which don't derive from std::exception)
    catch (...) {
        std::cerr << "Some fatal error\n";
    }
}
```

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

## History

SNU Programming Tools started out as the programming module for the website SNU that [seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001) started developing in 2018. This part didn't get created until 2020, when development went from Google Sites to self-hosted, and later to GitHub + Self hosting.

***

## Punch card support

This project has special support for classic programming language, and supports a virtual punch card format for languages like ALGOL, FORTRAN, and Assembly (early, pre-1970 versions) These punchcards are designed to emulate the experience of punchcard programming without having physical punch cards. This feature is still under development.

***

## Mod projects

Mod projects are separate projects included within the SNU Programming Tools set before the project was fully set on programming. They are still supported, and are planned to have continued support. Mods give support for software pieces, emulating sites like GitHub, and more.
