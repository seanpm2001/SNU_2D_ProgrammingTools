Installing SNU 2D Programming Tools
----

**Warning:** This program is not fully functional yet. It is still a major work in progress.

Please refer to the SNU Install instructions here for better instructions: https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/745564a46186888e829fdeb9cda584de

SNU 2D Programming Tools currently doesn't require installation (as of August 16th 2021) although it requires 1 program/package to be installed:

* HTML 5 or higher

Although, for this package, you can choose which languages you want to support and which ones you don't, down to the very version.

There is way too much to list here (ommitted 10000+ entries) just install the package related to the language you want to support.

For example, if you want to support PHP 7.3.2, install the PHP 7.3.2 package.

We trust you have experience with package installation to be reading this.

If you don't know how to do this, do some web searches through your preferred search engine(s)
