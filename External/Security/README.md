# Security notes

Dependabot has now given more security warnings towards dependencies in this project regarding the Degoogled Google Blockly implementation used. This is the only project I have that is reporting security issues.

I am bringing these to note here, as these are not a problem. Older versions of software are used on this project for archival purposes.
