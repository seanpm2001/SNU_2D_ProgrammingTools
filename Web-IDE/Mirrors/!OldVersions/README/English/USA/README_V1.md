## Mirrors

At the moment, this project is only mirorred on :octocat: GitHub. I plan to mirror to GitLab, BitBucket, SourceForge, and more in the future.

## What is a mirror?

[`Wikipedia definition oldid=1103509637`](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mirror_site&oldid=1103509637)

Mirror sites or mirrors are replicas of other websites or any network node. The concept of mirroring applies to network services accessible through any protocol, such as HTTP or FTP. Such sites have different URLs than the original site, but host identical or near-identical content. Mirror sites are often located in a different geographic region than the original, or upstream site. The purpose of mirrors is to reduce network traffic, improve access speed, ensure availability of the original site for technical or political reasons, or provide a real-time backup of the original site. Mirror sites are particularly important in developing countries, where internet access may be slower or less reliable. The maintainers of some mirrors choose not to replicate the entire contents of the upstream server they are mirroring because of technical constraints, or selecting only a subset relevant to their purpose, such as software written in a particular programming language, runnable on a single computer platform, or written by one author. These sites are called partial mirrors or secondary mirrors.
