# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is still in its early stages, and none of the versions are currently supported for security, as the system is not fully functional yet, and has not been tested fully.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DO NOT REPORT A ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY PUBLICLY!

Please instead direct message me via GitHub. If there is no response within 90 days, you can post the vulnerability as an issue, as part of the standard 0 day security exploit reporting guidelines.

If a vulnerability is caused by an outdated dependancy, you can report it publicly, as it usually isn't that much of a problem.

## Outdated dependencies

This project archives old versions of programming languages and their functionality. This includes old dependencies. I commonly get security advisories from Dependabot with the severity level of `moderate severity` these are not a problem. Please do not report them. Newer versions of languages are also provided, if you need a newer version, change the compatibility mode of the IDE session.

## Other

Other security info currently isn't available. If there are any further questions, @ me privately on GitHub. [@seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)
