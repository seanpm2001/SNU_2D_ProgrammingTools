On 2022, Tuesday, November 8th, I uploaded the logo for Berry here.
GitHub got stuck processing it, and I couldn't figure out what was going on, so I uploaded it again.
The newest commit came through, then a few minutes later, the previous stuck commit came through.
Since it is a duplicate, GitHub showed that there was another commit in the repository, but the commit wasn't being logged.

That is why I am writing this message, just to give context.
