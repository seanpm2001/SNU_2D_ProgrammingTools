A couple of very simple ZenScript files for minecraft

ZenScript is the custom scripting language used by the mod [CraftTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker) (and MineTweaker) to make simple changes like adding or removing recipes.

## To Use:
You need to install CraftTweaker found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker).

Then you can take any or all of these `.zs` files and put them in ./minecraft/scripts

## What the scripts do

 - **moarSignsRandomThingsCompat.zs** (requires [MoarSigns](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/moarsigns)) : adds a recipe to change a MoarSigns' `<Wood> Sign` into a vanilla `Sign`, so it can be used in recipes that require a vanilla `Sign` such as RandomThings' `Floo Sign`


 - **zombiesDropLeather.zs** : changes zombies so they have a 70% chance to drop `Rotten Flesh` and also a 70% chance to drop `Leather`
