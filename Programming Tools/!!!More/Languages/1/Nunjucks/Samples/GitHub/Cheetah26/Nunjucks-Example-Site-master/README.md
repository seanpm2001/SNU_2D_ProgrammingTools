# Nunjucks Example Site

A simple example site built using Nunjucks, and designed to show how to produce a static site with components.

## Building and running

To download the required Node modules, simply run `npm install` in the project directory

Once everything is downloaded, start the live server with `npm run serve`

Optionally you can just build the files without the live server by running `npm run build`
