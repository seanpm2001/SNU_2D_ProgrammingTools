   or: v ast -p demo.v    print the json output to stdout.

Description: Dump a JSON representation of the V AST for a given .v or .vsh file.
By default, `v ast` will save the JSON to a .json file, named after the .v file.
Pass -p to see it instead.

The arguments should be at least 1 in number.

Options:
  -w, --watch               watch a .v file for changes, rewrite the .json file, when a change is detected
  -p, --print               print the AST to stdout
  -c, --compile             watch the .v file for changes, rewrite the .json file, *AND* generate a .c file too on any change
  -t, --terse               terse output, only with tree node names (AST structure), no details
  --hide <multiple strings>
                            hide the specified fields. You can give several, by separating them with `,`
  -h, --help                display this help and exit
