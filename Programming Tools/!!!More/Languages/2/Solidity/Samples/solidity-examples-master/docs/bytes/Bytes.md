## description

The `Bytes` library has functions for working with bytes.

#### Bytes, strings, numbers and padding in Ethereum

In Ethereum, strings and bytes are padded on the lower-order (right) side with zero-bytes, while other types (such as numbers and addresses) are padded on the higher-order side. As an example, this is how we would store the string "abcd" in one full word (32 bytes):

`0x6162636400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

This is how the number `0x61626364` would be stored:

`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000061626364`

Solidity has built-in support for this, and will automatically use the correct padding rule depending on the type. The `web3.js` javascript API has built-in support for this as well, and padding is normally done automatically when javascript values are being encoded and decoded.

##### Using strings and hex-literals with fixed size bytes

Padding rule is important when working with literals. `bytesN` will use different internal representations for different types of literals.

1. Number literals assigned to `bytesN` variables are padded to the left.
2. String literals assigned to `bytesN` variables are padded to the right.

```
// 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001020304
var numLit = bytes32(0x01020304);

// 0x3031303230333034000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
var strLit = bytes32("01020304");
```

##### Index access in fixed size bytes

Accessing individual bytes by index is possible for all `bytesN` types (just as with the dynamic `bytes`). The highest order byte is found at index `0`.

```
var numLit_0 = numLit[0]; // 0
var numLit_31 = numLit[31]; // 0x04

var strLit_0 = strLit[0]; // 0x30
var strLit_31 = strLit[31]; // 0
```

##### Using `byte` in inline assembly

The `byte(index, data)` instruction will read the byte at position `index` from an item `data`, and put it on the stack. The range of `index` is `[0, 31]`.

```
uint numLit_0;
uint numLit_31;
assembly {
    numLit_0 := byte(0, numLit)
    numLit_31 := byte(31, numLit)
}
// numLit_0 == 0
// numLit_31 == 4
```

##### The `byte` (`bytes1`) type

The `byte` type, which is an alias for `bytes1`, stores a single byte. A `byte` is different then a number type of the same bit-size, like for example `uint8`, because their internal representations are different.

```
// 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
uint8 u8 = 1;

// 0x0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
byte b = 1;
```

This is important when converting between different types - especially when inline assembly is involved.

```
bytes32 b32 = "Terry A. Davis";
byte b;
assembly {
    b := byte(0, b32)
}
```

What is the value of `b` after this code has been run?

The value will be `0`, but the internal representation would be `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000054`, which lies outside of the allowed range so it is technically invalid.

Finally, these sections deal with bytes in memory and on the stack. For bytes packed in storage, things can be different.
